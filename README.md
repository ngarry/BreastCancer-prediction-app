# BreastCancer-prediction-app
This app is designed to assist medical professionals in making a diagnosis. 
However, it should not be used as a substitute for professional diagnosis

The project uses LogisticRegression as the ML model and streamlit for the front end. All 30 components for the app are scaled.

I use plotly for python. The radar chart takes in all components, scaled to display the values. The app allows manual input of the measurements and gives back feedback
on whether the cell tissue tested is malignant or benign.
